This is the Food Guide 2.0. For the Food Guide 2.0 - Lethbridge Food Guide, I used React to create a Single Page Web Page application that allows users to choose a cuisine from the dropdown menu, then I will fetch the data from the Zomato library to random generate a restaurant to user. It is a very fun project that I taught myself React, and I am addicted with the React framework now. React creates a friendly patterns of creating front end web apps, specificlly single page application, and it changes the way we think of a web page.
If you live in Lethbridge and have no idea where to go out for dinner with your friend, this app will be best for you!
