This is one of my favourite student project during my 4 years university life, and it is also my first app I made. I used PhoneGap and JQuery Moible to create this app since I had the fundational knowledge of JavaScript and JQuery. I created all functions and graphic. I spent most of my time making the food icons and making the app template. From this project, I understand my interest that I enjoy doing Front End tasks and making user interface. I am working on the second version of this app that I fetch the local restaurants and render it out.
