            My name is Ching Ching Lee and I've been building website for people.
            I completed my Bachelor of Fine Arts in New Media at the University of Lethbridge. My focus is on web
            development. And my favourite langauge is CSS.
            Over the last 4 years University life, I built up a strong passion for coding, and am proud to say "I love
            coding".
            I interned in a digital marketing agency in Calgary. During my work experience, I've been building websites
            for local communities and national companies.
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the strongest coding langauges I have so far. I love using these 3 languages
            because these langauges enchances the UI and UX of a website.
            Nowadays, I am very interested in the back-end development process and langauge since I've experienced PHP.
